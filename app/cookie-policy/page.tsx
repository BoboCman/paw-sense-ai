          information about you, such as which pages you visit, choices you make from menus, and the time and date of
          your visit.

          <span className="font-medium">(iii) Web beacons:</span> Pages of our website and our emails may contain small
          electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that
          permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics
          (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
