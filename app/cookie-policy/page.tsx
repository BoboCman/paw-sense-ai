        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#2980b9] border-b pb-2">What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a text-only string of information that the Services transfer to the "cookie" file of the browser
          you are using so that the Services can recognize your computer when you re-visit and remember certain
          information about you, such as which pages you visit, choices you make from menus, and the time and date of
          your visit.

      <section id="types-of-cookies">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#2980b9] border-b pb-2">Types of Cookies</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Our website uses three types of cookies:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <span className="font-medium">(i) Session cookies:</span> these are temporary cookies that expire when you
          close your browser. Session cookies allow the Services to recognize your computer as you navigate between
          pages during a single browser session, allowing you to use the Services most efficiently.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <span className="font-medium">(ii) Persistent cookies:</span> these are stored on your computer between
          browsing sessions until they expire or are deleted. They allow the Services to remember your preferences and
          tailor services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-medium">(iii) Web beacons:</span> Pages of our website and our emails may contain small
          electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that
          permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics
          (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

          Information Collected by our Analytics Software
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Some of the cookies we use are 'analytical' cookies. Our analytics software (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel
          and LinkedIn) allows us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the
          Services when they are using the Services. This helps us to improve the way the Services work, e.g., by making
          sure that users are finding what they need easily.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">The following types of information are collected by our analytics software:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            User's demographic information, e.g., language preference and location (city, country/territory, continent,
            sub-continental region).
          </li>
          <li>
            User's behavior, e.g., whether the user is a new or returning visitor, the frequency of visits/date of last
            visit.
          </li>
          <li>User's technology, e.g., operating system, network/service provider (ISP and network host).</li>
          <li>
            Mobile information, e.g. whether the user accessed the Services via a mobile device and, if so, the type of
            device (brand, service provider, operating system and input selection method).
          </li>
          <li>
            Traffic source, e.g., direct (i.e., the user typed in the URL themselves) or referral (i.e., the user
            clicked on a link) and for referral traffic, the traffic source (search engine or link); also the Google
            search term (if applicable) that resulted in the link to the Website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content viewed, e.g., pages, files, and directories clicked on, landing pages/exit pages and search words
            (if any) used on the Website.
